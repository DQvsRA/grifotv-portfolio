My role was the Flash development of the structure using Robotlegs and the whole story interaction, making sure pre-loading is seamless.</p></br><p>Rather than simply being a website that allows users to play around with the paint colour, door configuration choices and different interior options of the new Range Rover Evoque, Being Henry is an interactive film in which viewers get to decide how Henry proceeds through the narrative at various stages. Does he head straight into the restaurant to meet his sisters and grandma, or does he decide to walk around the corner and 'forget' about his family reunion?</p><br/><p>Each choice viewers make on behalf of the film's lead character, Henry, takes him on a different journey through a multiple strand story, and each choice also dictates a particular set up of a new model of Range Rover's Evoque model – which you find out when the film has played out. You then have the option to play around further with the car's colour, interior etc, or replay the film and try making different choices.</p><br/><p>For example, choose to ignore your family re-union to spend time with a young waitress, and the car you end up with will be the two door coupe version, rather than the five door family version... It sounds interestingly lateral yet potentially bland, but high production values, an unfussy, intuitive digital interface created by Less Rain, great performances, and a genuinely engaging set of numerous storylines and even more (over 30) endings, means that actually it's tricky to stop re-playing the film and exploring the different choices / narratives. With various plots that include such characters as a gun-toting grandma, a mafia-linked baker, and an attractive young waitress waiting for Henry in the back room of a diner – it's all rather good fun.</p>",

They came up with the idea of creating a vodka that would be made by Scottish distillers, using only Scottish barley and Scottish mountain water. A vodka so refined and so pure it needed an entirely new method of distillation. A quintuple micro-distillation technique was created especially. In true Scottish style the idea that began in that New York bar became a reality as VALT was first distilled on St. Andrews day and bottled on the anniversary of Robbie Burns’ birthday... The World’s first Single Malt Scottish Vodka was born.</p><br/><p>As expected most of people would associate Scotland to whisky.
